1) An Open Source project
-------------------------

ns-3 is a free open source project aiming to build a discrete-event
network simulator targeted for simulation research and education.   


2) Building ns-3
----------------

To build the set of default libraries and the example
programs included in this package, you need to use the
tool 'waf'. 
However, the real quick and dirty way to get started is to
type the command
  ./waf configure --enable-examples
followed by
  ./waf 

3) Running ns-3
---------------

On recent Linux systems, once you have built ns-3 (with examples
enabled), it should be easy to run the sample programs with the
following command, such as:

  ./waf --run simple-global-routing
