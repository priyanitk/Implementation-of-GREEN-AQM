1) An Open Source project
-------------------------

ns-3 is a free open source project aiming to build a discrete-event
network simulator targeted for simulation research and education.   

2) Building ns-3
----------------

The code for the framework and the default models provided
by ns-3 is built as a set of libraries. User simulations
are expected to be written as simple programs that make
use of these ns-3 libraries.
The real quick and dirty way to get started is to
type the command
  ./waf configure --enable-examples
followed by
  ./waf 
in the the directory which contains
this README file. The files built will be copied in the
build/ directory.


3) Running ns-3
---------------

On recent Linux systems, once you have built ns-3 (with examples
enabled), it should be easy to run the sample programs with the
following command, such as:

  ./waf --run simple-global-routing

That program should generate a simple-global-routing.tr text 
trace file and a set of simple-global-routing-xx-xx.pcap binary
pcap trace files, which can be read by tcpdump -tt -r filename.pcap
The program source can be found in the examples/routing directory.
